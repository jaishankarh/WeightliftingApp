check all validations

on delete cascade for competition and coefficients not working

competition update not there, that is to update coefficients and all -- wondering if this is required----

filter functionality in resultswindow and printcompetition not working fully -- wondering if this is required----

remove and add the group field in the lift table --this is required---

proper values not present can cause whole program to break, especially when inputting values from import, like gender missing etc- --should add dialogs to get these values...and enforce validations ---

add a quick import from file... that will quickly and cleverly import competition results
